Titel: Moving ball and button

No you don't get a screen shot, go look at it instead.

It's a ball that moves when you click the button. Click it a lot and it might get unstuck from the side. It's not very developed and not very good. This is of course my subjective opinion on it, but I think most people would agree. It was a rough week.
It demonstrates feedback through the moving ball being started by the button. On the notion of cybernetics, the "loop" is the ball changing direction, once it hit's a wall, though I don't know why it won't let go of the left side, while the loop is controlled by the user.

A promise to myself: I will do better than this. This is rockbottom.
